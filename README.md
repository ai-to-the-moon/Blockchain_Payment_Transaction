# Fintech Finder Application

The Fintech Finder application in `fintech_finder.py` and associated functions in `crypto_wallet.py` create a web application with streamlit that enables the user to send cryptocurrency payments to professionals that they "hire" from the app.  

## Technologies

This program is written in Python (3.7.13) and developed in VS Code on a Windows computer. Additional libraries used in this application are requests, dotenv, bip44, web3, streamlit, dataclasses, and typing.

## Installation Guide

Downloading the code & associated files using `git clone` from the repository is sufficient to download the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that the associated libaries (see Technologies section) are installed on your machine as well.  

## Usage

After activating your development environment, you can run the application simply by typing `streamlit run fintech_finder.py` from your command line. Make sure that you're in the root folder for the application and that your development environment with streamlit and other associated libraries are installed. 

Also, make sure that you have a `.env` file set up in your root directory with the mnemonic used for your crypto wallet. 

After running the application, your default browser should show you the application from your localhost address.

Here is what the application looks like:
